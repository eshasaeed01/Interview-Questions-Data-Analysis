# Interview-Questions-Data-Analysis


### Hi, I'm Esha! ðŸ‘‹ , Here are some details of this project:


### Project Overview
This Interview Questions Data Analysis aims to provide the insights of the survey details. By analysing the various aspects of the survey we seek to identify trends, and can gain deeper understanding of the people.

### Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is "file.csv" ,containing all the important information of the survey. I have also added that file in this repository.

### Tools
- Jupiter Notebook [Dowload here](https://jupyter.org/)

### Data Analysis
- Removing all null values in the dataset
- Filtering values
- Using seaborn for heatmap

### Limitations
I had to remove all the null values , because they can effect the analysis.
